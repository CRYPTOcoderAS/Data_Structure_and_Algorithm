# Data_Structure

This repository was used in Data Structure & Algorithms Webinar Organised by Developer Student Club Bijnor for demonstration. Speakers were [Kumar Shanu](https://github.com/its-Kumar/) and Shubham.

Implementation of popular **Data Structures** in two programming laguages i.e. C and Python by Me([Kumar Shanu](https://github.com/its-Kumar/)).\
This repository contains two directories

* Data_Structure_through_C
* DataStructure.py
* Algorithms_C
* Algorithms_py

## Data_Structure_Through_C

All Data Structures Implementation in **C language** using *pointers, structures, etc.*

* __GRAPHS

  * Graph implementation (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix, Path Matrix)
  * Graph Traversal(DFS, BFS, recursive and non-recursive)
  * Spanning Tree
  * Shortest Path

* __TREE

  * AVL Tree
  * Binary Search Tree
  * Expression Tree
  * Threaded Binary Tree, etc.



* Link list

  * Singly list
  * Doubly list
  * Cicular list
  * Polynomial list
  * Link List Operations, etc.

* Queue and Stack

  * Queue(Simple, Double Ended, Circular, Priority, etc.)
  * Stack(Array implementation, Linked List implementation)
  * Queue and Stack operations

## DataStructure.py

All Data Structure Implementation in **python language**

* Linked List
* Stack
* Queue
* Heap
